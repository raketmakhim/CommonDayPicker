# CommonDayPicker
When you have a group of friends trying to plan something and need to find the best day where everyone/most is available. 

Picker.getMode() returns the mode from a given List<Integer>.

Picker.pick() gets the dates and adds it all to a list from the given Hashmap and calls Picker.getMode() using this List.
